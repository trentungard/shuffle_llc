                    <h3>our story</h3>
                    <p>st. neumann hall, freshman year, myles penny was watching a youtube 
                    series titled, "deconstructed", in his room with his roommate chase 
                    campbell. this series broke down some of their favorite songs by their 
                    favorite artist. it was from these videos that myles became dissatisfied 
                    with the music industry and the way music was being handled. to gain a 
                    better understanding of the music industry, myles reached out to his 
                    friend lukas radulski, who was was an experienced producer and happened 
                    to live down the hall from myles in st. neumann hall. after talking with 
                    lukas about the ongoing problems in the music industry, both lukas and 
                    myles began to formulate ideas about how to conquer these problems. 
                    Shuffle. was born that night at la salle university in neumann 115.
